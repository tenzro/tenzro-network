//! Protocols for refreshing key shares when wanted/needed.
//!
//! This file implements a refresh protocol: periodically, all parties
//! engage in a protocol to re-randomize their secret values (while, of
//! course, still maintaining the same public key).
//!
//! The most direct way of doing this is simply executing DKG and restricting
//! the possible random values so that we don't change our address. We
//! implement this procedure under the name of "complete refresh".
//!
//! DKG also initializes the multiplication protocol, but we may take
//! advantage of the fact the we have already initialized this protocol
//! before. If we use this data for refresh, we don't need to execute
//! the OT protocols and we may save some time and some rounds. This
//! approach is implemented in another refresh protocol.
//!
//! ATTENTION: The protocols here work for any instance of Party, including
//! for derived addresses. However, refreshing a derivation is not such a
//! good idea because the refreshed derivation becomes essentially independent
//! of the master node. We recommend that only master nodes are refreshed
//! and derivations are calculated as needed afterwards.
//!
//! # Complete refresh
//!
//! In this case, we recompute all data from the parties. Hence, we essentially
//! rerun DKG but we force the final public key to be the original one.
//!
//! To adapt the DKG protocol, we change [Step 1](super::dkg::step1): instead of sampling any random
//! polynomial, each party generates a polynomial whose constant term is zero.
//! In this way, the key generation provides each party with a point on a polynomial
//! whose constant term (the "secret key") is zero. This new point is just a correction
//! factor and must be added to the original `poly_point` variable. This refreshes each
//! key share while preserving the same public key.
//!
//! Each party cannot trust that their adversaries really chose a polynomial
//! with zero constant term. Therefore, we must add a new consistency check in
//! [Phase 4](super::dkg::phase4): after recovering the auxiliary public key, each party must check that
//! it is equal to the zero point on the curve. This ensures that the correction
//! factors will not change the public key.
//!
//! # A faster refresh
//!
//! During a complete refresh, we initialize the multiplication protocol
//! from scratch. Instead, we can use our previous data to more efficiently
//! refresh this initialization. This results in a faster refresh and,
//! depending on the multiplication protocol, fewer communication rounds.
//!
//! We will base this implementation on the article "Refresh When You Wake Up:
//! Proactive Threshold Wallets with Offline Devices" (<https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1328.pdf>)
//! More specifically, we use their ideas from Section 8 (and Appendix E).
//!
//! In their protocol, a common random string is sampled by each pair of
//! parties. They achieve this by using their "coin tossing functionality".
//! Note that their suggestion of implementation for this functionality is
//! very similar to the way our zero shares protocol computes its seeds.
//!
//! Hence, our new refresh protocol will work as follows: we run DKG
//! ignoring any procedure related to the multiplication protocol (and we
//! do the same modifications we did for the complete refresh). During
//! the fourth phase, the initialization for the zero shares protocol
//! generates its seeds. We reuse them to apply the Beaver trick (described
//! in the article) to refresh the OT instances used for multiplication.
//!
//! # Nomenclature
//!
//! For the messages structs, we will use the following nomenclature:
//!
//! **Transmit** messages refer to only one counterparty, hence
//! we must produce a whole vector of them. Each message in this
//! vector contains the party index to whom we should send it.
//!
//! **Broadcast** messages refer to all counterparties at once,
//! hence we only need to produce a unique instance of it.
//! This message is broadcasted to all parties.
//!
//! ATTENTION: we broadcast the message to ourselves as well!
//!
//! **Keep** messages refer to only one counterparty, hence
//! we must keep a whole vector of them. In this implementation,
//! we use a `BTreeMap` instead of a vector, where one can put
//! some party index in the key to retrieve the corresponding data.
//!
//! **Unique keep** messages refer to all counterparties at once,
//! hence we only need to keep a unique instance of it.
