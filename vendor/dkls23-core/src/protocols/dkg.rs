//! Distributed Key Generation protocol.
//!
//!  This file implements Protocol 9.1 in <https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/602.pdf>,
//! as instructed in `DKLs23` (<https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/765.pdf>). It is
//! the distributed key generation which setups the main signing protocol.
//!
//! During the protocol, we also initialize the functionalities that will
//! be used during signing.
//!
//! # Phases
//!
//! We group the steps in phases. A phase consists of all steps that can be
//! executed in order without the need of communication. Phases should be
//! intercalated with communication rounds: broadcasts and/or private messages
//! containing the session id.
//!
//! We also include here the initialization procedures of Functionalities 3.4
//! and 3.5 of `DKLs23`. The first one comes from [here](crate::utilities::zero_shares)
//! and needs two communication rounds (hence, it starts on Phase 2). The second one
//! comes from [here](crate::utilities::multiplication) and needs one communication round
//! (hence, it starts on Phase 3).
//!
//! For key derivation (following BIP-32: <https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki>),
//! parties must agree on a common chain code for their shared master key. Using the
//! commitment functionality, we need two communication rounds, so this part starts
//! only on Phase 2.
//!
//! # Nomenclature
//!
//! For the initialization structs, we will use the following nomenclature:
//!
//! **Transmit** messages refer to only one counterparty, hence
//! we must produce a whole vector of them. Each message in this
//! vector contains the party index to whom we should send it.
//!
//! **Broadcast** messages refer to all counterparties at once,
//! hence we only need to produce a unique instance of it.
//! This message is broadcasted to all parties.
//!
//! ATTENTION: we broadcast the message to ourselves as well!
//!
//! **Keep** messages refer to only one counterparty, hence
//! we must keep a whole vector of them. In this implementation,
//! we use a `BTreeMap` instead of a vector, where one can put
//! some party index in the key to retrieve the corresponding data.
//!
//! **Unique keep** messages refer to all counterparties at once,
//! hence we only need to keep a unique instance of it.
//!
//! The keep-state types in this module, along with [`phase1`] through
//! [`phase4`], are public low-level APIs for advanced resumable/stateless
//! orchestration. [`crate::DkgSession`] remains the preferred high-level API.
