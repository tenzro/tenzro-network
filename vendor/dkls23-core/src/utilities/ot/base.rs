//! Base OT.
//!
//! This file implements an oblivious transfer (OT) which will serve as a base
//! for the OT extension protocol.
//!
//! As suggested in page 30 of `DKLs23` (<https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/765.pdf>),
//! we implement the endemic OT protocol of Zhou et al., which can be found on
//! Section 3 of <https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1525.pdf>.
//!
//! There are two phases for each party and one communication round between
//! them. Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 can be done concurrently for the sender
//! and the receiver.
//
//! There is also an initialization function which should be executed during
//! Phase 1. It saves some values that can be reused if the protocol is applied
//! several times. As this will be our case for the OT extension, there are
//! "batch" variants for each of the phases.
