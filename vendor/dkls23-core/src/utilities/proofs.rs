//! Zero-knowledge proofs required by the protocols.
//!
//! This file implements some protocols for zero-knowledge proofs over the
//! curve secp256k1.
//!
//! The main protocol is for proofs of discrete logarithms. It is used during
//! key generation in the `DKLs23` protocol (<https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/765.pdf>).
//!
//! For the base OT in the OT extension, we use the endemic protocol of Zhou et al.
//! (see Section 3 of <https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1525.pdf>). Thus, we also include
//! another zero knowledge proof employing the Chaum-Pedersen protocol, the
//! OR-composition and the Fiat-Shamir transform (as in their paper).
//!
//! # Discrete Logarithm Proof
//!
//! We implement Schnorr's protocol together with a randomized Fischlin transform
//! (see [`DLogProof`]).
//!
//! We base our implementation on Figures 23 and 27 of Zhou et al.
//!
//! For convenience, instead of writing the protocol directly, we wrote first an
//! implementation of the usual Schnorr's protocol, which is interactive (see [`InteractiveDLogProof`]).
//! Since it will be used for the non-interactive version, we made same particular choices
//! that would not make much sense if this interactive proof were used alone.
//!
//! # Encryption Proof
//!
//! The OT protocol of Zhou et al. uses an `ElGamal` encryption at some point
//! and it needs a zero-knowledge proof to verify its correctness.
//!
//! This implementation follows their paper: see page 17 and Appendix B.
//!
//! IMPORTANT: As specified in page 30 of `DKLs23`, we instantiate the protocols
//! above over the same elliptic curve group used in our main protocol.
